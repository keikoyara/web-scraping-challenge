# web-scraping-challenge

In this repository you will find a folder called Mission_to_Mars where you can find:
- a Jupyter Notebook scraping the websites
- a  scrape_mars.py file with the scrape function
- an app.py file using flask 
- a folder named template with an index.html file to format the Mars data 
- an images folder with screenshots


Unfortunately, I was not able to successfully render the data with flask. I have spent many hours trying to debug code with no success. I have included images of my html code and the error I see when I run the app.py file. I am going to continue to work on debugging. I hope that I will be able to re-submit this with a working code.
